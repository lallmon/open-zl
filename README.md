# Getting Started

Dependencies:

Git **including LFS**: needs to be installed on your system, you can get it here https://git-scm.com/downloads defaults are fine, but be sure to install LFS as well or this wont work.

If you add any binary files not already added in the `.gitattributes` file, you need to run `git lfs track "*.psd"` with the new file type.
